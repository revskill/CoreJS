MVC Web Application Framework for NodeJS written in CoffeeScript
===

CoreJS is an Open Source Web Application Framework, using the [MVC Architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) written in CoffeeScript,
allowing you to create Powerful Web Applications with ease, keeping your code clean & readable.

Using an Object Oriented workflow, you can create, extend and reuse classes to be used within your applications. You can configure several environments for your applications,
using a common configuration approach. Prototypal inheritance is used behind the scenes to provide a simpler Object Oriented Inheritance.

You have a build system based on [Cake](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/#cake), CoffeeScript's build tool similar to [Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/). This allows you to automate and configure several aspects of your applications,
such as building the documentation, or performing maintenance / cleanup.
